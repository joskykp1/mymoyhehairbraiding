              <p>Drawing from the latest trends we've spotted on runways, social media, and our own salon chairs, here are the top box braid styles dominating 2025. We've included tips on how to rock them, maintenance advice, and why they're a hit for Charlotte's diverse, on-the-go crowd. Ready to elevate your look? Let's dive in!</p>

              <h3>1. Knotless Box Braids: The Comfort Queens</h3>
              <p>Knotless box braids have been the breakout star of 2025, and for good reason—they're lighter, more natural-looking, and gentler on your edges. Without the bulky knots at the roots, these braids reduce tension and allow for easier styling.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it's trending in Charlotte:</strong> With our humid summers and active lifestyles (think Uptown strolls or hikes at Freedom Park), knotless braids stay fresh longer without pulling.</p>
              <p><strong>2025 Twist:</strong> Go for medium-sized braids with subtle highlights in warm tones like honey blonde or caramel for a sun-kissed glow.</p>
              <p><strong>Length & Customization:</strong> Shoulder-length for everyday chic or waist-length for drama. Add beads or cuffs for a personalized touch.</p>
              <p><strong>Maintenance Tip:</strong> Moisturize your scalp weekly with a lightweight oil like jojoba to prevent dryness. These can last 6-8 weeks with proper care.</p>
              <p><strong>Pro Tip from Moyhe:</strong> Our stylists recommend this for first-timers—book a consultation to match your hair type perfectly!</p>

              <h3>2. Goddess Box Braids: Bohemian Vibes Meet Elegance</h3>
              <p>Infusing box braids with loose, wavy ends, goddess braids bring a ethereal, free-spirited flair. This style exploded on TikTok and Instagram this year, blending structure with softness.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it's trending in Charlotte:</strong> Ideal for festivals like the Charlotte Shout or casual brunches in NoDa—it's versatile for both professional and playful settings.</p>

              <p><strong>Length & Customization:</strong> Mid-back length with face-framing layers to accentuate your features.</p>
              <p><strong>Maintenance Tip:</strong> Wrap them in a silk bonnet at night to preserve the waves. Refresh ends with a curl-defining spray every few days.</p>

              <h3>3. Jumbo Box Braids: Bold and Quick</h3>
              <p>For those who want volume without the wait, jumbo box braids are the go-to. Thicker sections mean faster installation and a statement-making presence.</p>

              <p><strong>Length & Customization:</strong> Hip-length for maximum impact, or bob-style for a fresh, youthful cut.</p>
              <p><strong>Maintenance Tip:</strong> Use a wide-tooth comb for detangling and avoid heavy products to prevent buildup. Lasts 4-6 weeks.</p>
              <p><strong>Pro Tip from Moyhe:</strong> Our experts can install these in under 4 hours—ideal if you're short on time!</p>

              <h3>4. Colored Box Braids: Vibrant and Expressive</h3>
              <p>2025 has been all about self-expression, and colored box braids let you play with hues without committing to dye. From pastels to neons, the options are endless.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it's trending in Charlotte:</strong> With the city's vibrant arts scene (hello, Blumenthal Performing Arts), colorful braids add personality to everyday outfits.</p>
              <p><strong>2025 Twist:</strong> Ombré effects fading from black roots to fiery reds or blues, inspired by Afro-futurism trends.</p>
              <p><strong>Length & Customization:</strong> Long and layered, with color pops focused on the ends for low-commitment fun.</p>
              <p><strong>Maintenance Tip:</strong> Protect from sun fading with UV sprays and wash less frequently. These hold color well for 5-7 weeks.</p>
